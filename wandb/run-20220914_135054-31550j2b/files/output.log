/home/guest1/.conda/envs/ellen/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.py:134: UserWarning: Detected call of `lr_scheduler.step()` before `optimizer.step()`. In PyTorch 1.1.0 and later, you should call them in the opposite order: `optimizer.step()` before `lr_scheduler.step()`.  Failure to do this will result in PyTorch skipping the first value of the learning rate schedule. See more details at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate

This will likely lead to incorrect results due to broadcasting. Please ensure they have the same size.
